## Description
This is an unsupervised learning model that uses Decision Tree to determine the chances of survival of passengers on Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, etc. <br
This notebook includes an EDA to clean up the dataset and ensure a more accurate model of prediction.

## How to install
Juypyter notebook and Python 3 are required to run this model.
The following Python libraries will also need to be installed:
- Numpy
- Maptlotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Scikit learn

## How to use
This model is built using the CSV [Titanic dataset](https://github.com/CatherineSchalbroeck/Decision-Trees/blob/main/titanic.csv) which is available in this repository. 

## Credits
This model was built by myself with the support material provided by **HyperionDev** in my Task assignment.
